Freiheit

Freiheit is a blockchain platform based on hyperledger Composer, the goal is to provide trustable and convenient blockchain service to public, mainly free while some paid services could be offered.

In the history of human life, seeking independence and freedom are important for every individual, no matter strong or weak, smart or dumb, noble or average. From stone age to steam engine, we free our hands from labour work, focusing more or art, sciences, literature etc. In electrical and digital era, the life has been expanded unprecedently. We make night as bright as day time, we connect with each other more close than we could ever imagine, we improve the efficiency more higher than ever. But one thing is still missing: trust.

The freedom to trade, to work, to create is the obligation, we owe to ourself as well as to god. We do not want to control anyone, because it's evil. We want to help, to facilitate others to work and live the life in their dream. We want to bring trust to the world in every aspect we can reach in. We don't have to push others, we create the cool things that all the people will follow, we wanna be the coolest, smartest community to support all the people trying to make their life easier and happier.

A great project should base on our continuous hard work. Let's start it now.
